<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>These are just some notes as I try to get up to speed on differential and Riemannian geometry. My main reference is Manfredo do Carmo’s <em>Riemannian Geometry</em>.</p>
<h1 id="pre-requisites">Pre-Requisites</h1>
<p>This section contains pre-requisite information for the rest of these notes. Statements here are presented without proof, but Manfredo do Carmo’s <em>Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces</em> is a good resource.</p>
<div class="def">
<p><strong>Multi-variable Chain Rule</strong>: Let <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> be a function of <span class="math inline">\(x_1,\dots,x_n\)</span> and each <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> be a function of <span class="math inline">\(t_1,\dots,t_m\)</span>. Then the partial derivative of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> with respect to the variable <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> is given by: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation} \frac{\partial z}{\partial t_i} = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} \frac{\partial z}{\partial x_j} \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial t_i}. \end{equation}\]</span></p>

<p><strong>Differentials between mappings in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span></strong>: Let <span class="math inline">\(F:U\subset\mathbb{R}^n \to\mathbb{R}^m\)</span> be a differentiable map. To each <span class="math inline">\(p\in U\)</span> we associate a linear map <span class="math inline">\(dF_p:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m\)</span> which is called the <em>differential</em> of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and is defined as follows: let <span class="math inline">\(w\in\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha:(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to U\)</span> be a differentiable curve such that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(0) = p, \alpha&#39;(0) = w\)</span>. By the chain rule, the curve <span class="math inline">\(\beta = F\circ\alpha:(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to\mathbb{R}^m\)</span> is also differentiable. Then <span class="math inline">\(dF_p(w) = \beta&#39;(0)\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>The Jacobian and Jacobian Determinant</strong>: The matrix of <span class="math inline">\(dF_p:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m\)</span> in the canonical bases of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^m\)</span>, that is, the matrix <span class="math inline">\((\partial f_i / \partial x_j), i = 1,\dots,m, j = 1,\dots, n\)</span>, is called the <em>Jacobian matrix</em> of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(n = m\)</span>, this is a square matrix and its determinant is called the <em>Jacobian determinant</em> denoted by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{equation*} \text{det}\left(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}\right) = \frac{\partial(f_1,\dots,f_n)}{\partial(x_1,\dots,x_n)}. \end{equation*}\]</span></p>

<p><strong>Inverse Function Theorem</strong>: Let <span class="math inline">\(F: U\subset\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> be a differentiable mapping and suppose that at <span class="math inline">\(p\in U\)</span> the differential <span class="math inline">\(dF_p:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is an isomorphism. Then there exists a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(F(p)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(F:V\to W\)</span> has a differentiable inverse <span class="math inline">\(F^{-1}:W\to V\)</span>.</p>

<div class="def">
<p><strong>Definition of a Regular Surface in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span></strong>: A subset <span class="math inline">\(S\subset\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> is a <em>regular surface</em> if for all <span class="math inline">\(p \in S\)</span> there exists a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> and a mapping <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}:U\subset\mathbb{R}^2\to V\cap S\)</span> of an open set <span class="math inline">\(U\subset \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\(V\cap S\)</span> such that</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> is a differentiable homeomorphism,</li>
<li>The differential <span class="math inline">\(dx_q:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> is injective for all <span class="math inline">\(q \in U\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The map <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> is called a <em>parametrization</em> of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Transition from one parametrization to another is a diffeomorphism, that is, if <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}\left(U_{\alpha}\right)\cap\mathbf{x}_{\beta}\left(U_{\beta}\right) = W \neq \emptyset\)</span>, then the transition maps <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{\beta}^{-1}\circ\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}:\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}^{-1}(W)\to\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}^{-1}\circ\mathbf{x}_{\beta}:\mathbf{x}_{\beta}^{-1}(W)\to\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> are differentiable.</p>
<p>So a regular surface intuitively is a union of open sets of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> living in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> such that when two such open sets interact with each other, the change from one to another can be made in a differentiable way.</p>
<h1 id="differential-manifolds">Differential Manifolds</h1>
<p>We begin with some basic definitions.</p>
<div class="def">
<p><strong>Differential Manifold of Dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></strong>: A <em>differential manifold of dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></em> is a set <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (sometimes written as <span class="math inline">\(M^n\)</span> to denote the dimension) and a family of injective mappings <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}:U_{\alpha}\subset\mathbb{R}^n \to M\)</span> of open sets <span class="math inline">\(U_{\alpha}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> such that</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\bigcup_{\alpha} \mathbf{x}_{\alpha}\left(U_{\alpha}\right) = M\)</span>,</li>
<li>for any pair <span class="math inline">\(\alpha,\beta\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}\left(U_{\alpha}\right)\cap \mathbf{x}_{\beta}\left(U_{\beta}\right) = W \neq \emptyset\)</span>, the sets <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}^{-1}\left(W\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{\beta}^{-1}\left(W\right)\)</span> are open sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and the mappings <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{\beta}^{-1} \circ x_{\alpha}\)</span> are differentiable,</li>
<li>the family <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\left(U_{\alpha}, \mathbf{x}_{\alpha}\right)\right\}\)</span> is maximal relative to the first two conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The pair <span class="math inline">\(\left(U_{\alpha},\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}\right)\)</span> is called a <em>parametrizations</em> or <em>system of coordinates</em> of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The sets <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}\left(U_{\alpha}\right)\)</span> are called a <em>coordinate neighborhood</em> at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. We should think of this as giving coordinates for <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (more on this later). A family <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\left(U_{\alpha},\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}\right)\right\}\)</span> satisfying conditions (1) and (2) above is called a <em>differentiable structure</em> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Condition (1) says that the images of the parametrizations cover <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, and condition (2) is exactly the condition that transition from one parametrization to another is a diffeomorphism (notice how this baked into the definition now rather than a consequence as in the definition of a regular surface in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>).</p>
<p>For the sake of condition (3), we should also check that given a differentiable structure on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, we can complete it to a maximal one: take the union of all parametrizations that satisfy condition (2) with any of the parametrizations of the given structure. This resulting differentiable structure clearly satisfies conditions (1) and (2) and is maximal because any other differentiable structure will be contained in this one.</p>
<p>A differentiable structure on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> also induces a natural topology on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> by the following: the set <span class="math inline">\(A\subset M\)</span> is defined to be open iff <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_\alpha^{-1}\left(A\cap\mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right)\)</span> is open in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. We should check that this actually gives us a topology:</p>
<div class="proof">
<p>Proof: We first show that the trivial sets <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> are open in this proposed topology. Firstly, we have that <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*} \mathbf{x}_{\alpha}^{-1}\left(M\cap\mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right) = \mathbf{x}_{\alpha}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right) = U_\alpha \end{equation*}\]</span> which is open. We also have that <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*} \mathbf{x}_{\alpha}^{-1}\left(\emptyset\cap\mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right) = \mathbf{x}_{\alpha}^{-1}\left(\emptyset\right) = \emptyset \end{equation*}\]</span> which is also open. So <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> are both open. We now check that this collection of sets is closed under finite intersections. Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be open. Then we have <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*} \mathbf{x}_{\alpha}^{-1}\left(A\cap B\cap\mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right) &amp;= \mathbf{x}_\alpha^{-1}\left(\left(A\cap\mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right)\cap\left(B\cap\mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right)\right) \\ &amp;= \mathbf{x}_\alpha^{-1}\left(A \cap \mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right) \cap \mathbf{x}_\alpha^{-1}\left(B\cap\mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right), \end{align*}\]</span> which is a intersection of two open sets and hence is open. Here we used the fact that inverse images of an intersection of two sets is the intersection of the inverse images of each set. Finally we check closure under arbitrary unions. Let <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> be open for each <span class="math inline">\(i\in I\)</span>. Then we have <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*} \mathbf{x}_\alpha^{-1}\left(\left(\bigcup\limits_{i\in I} A_i\right)\cap\mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right) &amp;= \mathbf{x}_\alpha^{-1}\left(\bigcup\limits_{i\in I}\left(A_i\cap\mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right)\right) \\ &amp;= \bigcup\limits_{i\in I}\mathbf{x}_\alpha^{-1}\left(A_i\cap\mathbf{x}_\alpha\left(U_\alpha\right)\right)\end{align*}\]</span> which is an arbitrary union of open sets and hence open. In the last step above we also used the fact that inverse image commutes with arbitrary unions. So this is indeed a topology. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
